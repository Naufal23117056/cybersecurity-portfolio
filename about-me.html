										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>

									<p>Hello, my name is Muhammad Ghaisannaufal Taher. I am student doing my Masters in Cybersecurity at University Malaya. Previously, I was a student in International Islamic University Malaysia doing Bachelors in Information Technology. I was previously in Digital Media Design, where I would then pivot to cybersecurity. It may sound a bit strange as to why I made the decision, but my honest answer is that I simply wished to learn more, and better understand this part of the IT industry.</p>
									<p>The world of computers and networks to me have always been too abstract in my point of view, and though it will be difficult for someone like me enter this area of expertise, I am determined to learn and understand this industry. Another reason is that, as the world around as becomes more and more digitised, it becomes imperitive to improve security, as our daily activities increasingly rely on this digital world.</p>

									<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
									<p>I have a wide array of skills that I have amassed during my bachelor’s degree, but very few of them are relevant in the world of cyber security. The few skills that have carried over are:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Programming Skills (C++, C#, Java)</li>
										<li>Basic Computer Networking</li>
										<li>Basic Cybersecurity</li>
									</ul>
									<p>I am currently doing my Masters in Cybersecurity, and it has introduced me to an even deeper understanding of how the industry works. Though I’ve not yet finished my degree as of writing this (12/1/2025), I acquired a respectable number of skills under my belt, and I’m eager to learn more.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Programming (Python)</li>
										<li>Basic Penetration Testing</li>
										<li>Advanced computer networking</li>
										<li>Operating GNS3</li>
									</ul>

									<h2>Learning Journey</h2>
									<p>Although this journey has been relatively short currently, I find it to be a very enlightening experience. I was always interested on the machinations and processes of the world of cybersecurity. I had a rudimentary grasp on how networking works, but I can say that I now have a firmer understanding on the subject. However, to be truthful, I must admit that the world of cybersecurity and networking still does not click for me.</p>
									<p>I understand enough on how it works, in the sense that I know what the causes and effects are. But I still do not comprehend how it works on a more fundamental level, it all still seems very abstract to me. Like knowing that if I were to stop holding a ball, it would fall but with no understanding on how gravity works. I am trying my best though, and I hope that one day I can say that I truly understand how it works, or at least a good grasp on the subject. I hope this journey will lead me there.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Career Objective</h2>
									<p>Regarding my career objective in the world of cybersecurity, I still do not know in my heart what I want to do. I do have an inkling on how it works, that I should start as a security analyst and work my way up. But I find myself leaning towards being a penetration tester. I find the task of penetration testing to be very appealing as I kind of see it as a puzzle solving job. Other than that, I also find myself being fond of being in digital forensics.</p>
