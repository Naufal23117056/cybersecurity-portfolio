									<h2>Project Experience</h2>
									<p>As mentioned before, I currently have a limited experience in cybersecurity, so -as of this moment- do not have a lot of projects of note. But, in my time doing my Masters, I got the opportunity to do a few. Here are a few of them:</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Programming Scripts with Scapy</h3>
									<p>During my programming course for cybersecurity, I was introduced to Python, particularly the library Scapy. With this I was able to create a few scripts:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Port Scanner</li>
										<li>Vulnerability Scanner using Shodan</li>
										<li>An automated system that scans an ip address for ports and detecting any vulnerabilities, which then emails a full report directly to me</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
									<h3>Computer Networking</h3>
									<p>I configured networks in simulations via GNS3 as well as physically. I was able to set up a DHCP server on a router as well as on a toolbox operating in Ubuntu, where it assigns IP addresses to all devices in a network. Next, I was able to set up a network using a layer 3 switch and connected three routers together using EIGRP. With this network set up, I was able to simulate a MAC address spoofing attack on a router, feeding it false mac addresses that do not exist.</p>

									<h2>Certifications and Training</h2>
									<p>Unfortunately, I do not have any certifications or training on cybersecurity yet, but I am planning to get them in the future. The only certification I currently have is a CCNA certification</p>

									<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
									<p>I have a wide array of skills that I have amassed during my bachelor’s degree, but very few of them are relevant in the world of cyber security. The few skills that have carried over are:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Programming Skills (C++, C#, Java)</li>
										<li>Basic Computer Networking</li>
										<li>Basic Cybersecurity</li>
									</ul>
									<p>I am currently doing my Masters in Cybersecurity, and it has introduced me to an even deeper understanding of how the industry works. Though I’ve not yet finished my degree as of writing this (12/1/2025), I acquired a respectable number of skills under my belt, and I’m eager to learn more.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Programming (Python)</li>
										<li>Basic Penetration Testing</li>
										<li>Advanced computer networking</li>
										<li>Operating GNS3</li>
									</ul>
